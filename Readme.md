A small [https://pnut.io](Pnut.io) bot and website, which mainly serves two purposes. (They're further explained in public_html/index.html)

Can be pretty much cloned and run as-is, with the only exception being a file called `clientsecret` in the root directory, containing the client secret (duh). If you don't have one, get it [here](https://pnut.io/dev)

The bot is currently called roughly every 30 minutes by a cronjob, so any follows/new club memberships might take a while to show up
